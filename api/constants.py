# This is a bit tricky, since we allow different node selectors potentially for

# per million really can change depending on the node selector.
# For example:
#  llama-3-8b with node selector requiring minimally an h100
#  Example h100 hourly price (subject to change): $1.5
#  $/million = $1.5 * 0.01358695 = $0.02/million input
#            = $1.5 * 0.05434782 = $0.08/million output

# total concurrent tokens in KV cache, such as GLM-4.5-FP8 at full context
